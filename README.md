# Advanced Algorithm project

# Professor Requirements
For the project you will have to design a distributed algorithm and to implement it using real robots that are programmable using the C language. You will then have to:

1) write a report by your own,

2) give a practical demonstration in group,

3)  eventually participate to a Robot Demo Day with all the other groups (this will be decided later).

The project should be presented before the last exam session in September 2021. If you finish earlier is even better.

The topic is the following:

You have to program the same distributed algorithm on each robot. The robots will have to start scattered on the plane (from an initial random position), and for two times should:

1) gather in a point

2) form an equilateral triangle

3) form a line

and repeat points 1,2,3  another time.

The algorithm has to be the same and the robots should be considered identical.
